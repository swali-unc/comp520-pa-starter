// TODO: Enumate the types of tokens we have.
//   Consider taking a look at the terminals in the Grammar.
//   What types of tokens do we want to be able to differentiate between?
//   E.g., I know "class" and "while" will result in different syntax, so
//   it makes sense for those reserved words to be their own token types.
//
// This may result in the question "what doesn't result in different syntax?"
//   By example, if binary operations are always "x binop y"
//   Then it makes sense for -,+,*,etc. to be one TokenType "operator" that can be accepted,
//      (E.g. compare accepting the stream: Expression Operator Expression Semicolon
//       compare against accepting stream: Expression (Plus|Minus|Multiply) Expression Semicolon.)
//   and then in a later assignment, we can peek at the Token's underlying text
//   to differentiate between them.
